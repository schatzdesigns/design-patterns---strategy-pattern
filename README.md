# Design Patterns in Object Oriented Programming

# Strategy Pattern

From Wikipedia:
In computer programming, the strategy pattern (also known as the policy pattern) is a behavioral software design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm at runtime. Instead of implementing a single algorithm directly, code receives run-time instructions as to which in a family of algorithms to use.

Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
